Plugin to create a users community on any WordPress blog. You will have user profiles pages, photo galleries, private messaging and much more.

== Description ==

A plugin to build user communities all around WordPress, mainly itâ€™s around having a well integrated profiles system. This plugin will provide all needed functions and widgets to make it easy and flexible the ways to show all information about a user. Also, there is some user privacy settings to permit which information to show in the profile page.

With this plugin, you can manage you user profiles and have a user list. For each user, a profile page is provided. The information shown in the profile page is based on your privacy settings.
Also, you can select the user list order, ascending or descending, and ordering by different fields: ID, login name, display name or date registered.

WordPress avatars can be replaced by local avatars. And also a user picture at big size, is shown in the user profile page. This requires the Gallery component running.
For the user profile pages, the labels for IM addresses can be replaced by your own. (As example, you can change 'Yahoo IM' for 'Skype').
In the WordPress login page, the WordPress logo can be replaced, and the links will be changed to point to your blog. (By default the WordPress logo is shown and the links point to the WordPress site).

All pages use templates, so you can create you own output template to customize and style all displayed pages. The templetes directory can be moved outside the plugin to prevent loosing your custom templates on update.
